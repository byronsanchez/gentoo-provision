.TH selinuxnode 7 "21 February 2013" "February 21st, 2013" "Gentoo Hardened SELinux Node Information"
.SH NAME
selinuxnode \- Example SELinux-enabled Gentoo Hardened image
.SH USAGE
.SS "FIRST THINGS FIRST"
This playground image has been cleaned up a bit to reduce system
space. One of the things you will need to run first is emerge-webrsync
to populate the portage tree again. Afterwards you need to regenerate
the metadata as the dependency cache has been cleared as well.

.PP
Update the configuration files in /etc to suit your system
environment, including
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
setting keymap in /etc/conf.d/keymaps to your keyboard
layout, after which you can remove askkeymaps from the default
runlevel
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
copying the right zone file from /usr/share/zoneinfo onto
/etc/localtime.
.SS "THE USER, OPER AND ROOT USERS"
On this SELinux node, four users are defined.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
user is a regular system user, mapped to the SELinux user_u
user
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
oper is a regular system user for operators and
administrators, mapped to the SELinux staff_u user
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
root is an administrative user, mapped to the SELinux root
user
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
test is a regular system user, mapped to the SELinux user_u
user (but meant as a test user when creating additional
roles)
.PP
These SELinux mappings define which actions a user is allowed to
take. For instance user_u is not able to switch roles and thus will
never be able to manage the system. The oper user by default works in
the staff_r role, so is limited in his ability to manage the system,
until he switches his role to sysadm_r using \fBnewrole -r
sysadm_r\fR. The root user either logs in in the staff_r role
(remote login) or sysadm_r (local login).
.SH "COMMAND REFERENCE"
.SS "SELINUX COMMAND REFERENCE"
For a full explanation of all the SELinux-related commands, please
read the Gentoo Hardened SELinux handbook at
http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/selinux
.TP 
newrole -r <role>
Switch to the specified SELinux role. Supported roles are
staff_r and sysadm_r (user_r is supported too but will not be
switched to nor switched from).
.TP 
setenforce [0 | 1]
Disable (0) or enable (1) SELinux enforcing mode. By
default, the node boots in enforcing mode.
.SH "ABOUT THIS IMAGE"
.SS "SPECIFIC PORTAGE SETTINGS"
Due to the support of IMA/EVM, the ima-evm-utils package is
currently inside the package.accept_keywords definitions. Also all
SELinux-related packages are mentioned therein to be at the latest
(~arch) version.
